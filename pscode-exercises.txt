// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

if num can be % 2 equally print even
else print odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

ask for 5 numbers
sort numbers in ascending numerical order (min to max)
print numbers in ascending numerical order (min to max)
add those 5 numbers together
print sum
divide sum by 5
print solution (solution is the average of those 5 numbers)

(6, 9, 3, 14, 2) --5 numbers that were asked for
2, 3, 6, 9, 14 --"those same numbers" sorted and printed in ascending numerical order (min to max)
2 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 14 --"" added together
34 --sum is printed
34 / 5 --sum divided by 5
6.8 --the solution to the equation (the average)
